# Drug-Selection-with-logistic-regrssion-and-classication

DRUG SELECTION MODEL:
In this model there are 5 different drugs A,B,C,X and Y.
According to Age, Sex and medical conditions we have to predict which drug is suitable.
Different ML Techniques are used like EDA , Data Cleaning, Model Building, Accuracy Checking.
Model made with Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor.

Conclusion:

Model made with Logistic Regression gives Accuracy of 91.66%

Model made with Classification(KNN) gives Accuracy of 71.66%
